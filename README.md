# Asteroids Game (Python/Pygame)

A classic 2D space shooter game, "Asteroids," built from scratch in Python using the **Pygame** library. This project recreates the retro arcade experience where you control a spaceship in an asteroid field, dodging and shooting rocks to survive.

## Features

* **Classic Controls**: Rotate your ship, thrust forward, and fire bullets.
* **Physics-Based Movement**: Smooth, vector-based movement for the player and asteroids.
* **Screen Wrapping**: Seamlessly wrap around the screen edges just like the original.
* **Collision Detection**: Accurate (circular) collision detection between all game objects.
* **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean, modular code with separate classes for `Player`, `Asteroid`, and `Shot`.
* **Asteroid Spawning**: An `AsteroidField` class manages the creation and state of asteroids.

## Setup & Installation

This project uses `uv` and a `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies, the main one being **Pygame**.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/1920xl080/Asteroids.git](https://github.com/1920xl080/Asteroids.git)
    cd Asteroids
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    *If you use `uv`*:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    *If you use `pip`*:
    ```bash
    # You may need to create a virtual environment first
    pip install pygame
    ```

## How to Play

Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

```bash
python main.py
````

### Controls

*(Please verify these controls in `main.py` or `player.py` and update as needed)*

  * **Left Arrow**: Rotate ship left
  * **Right Arrow**: Rotate ship right
  * **Up Arrow**: Apply thrust and move forward
  * **Spacebar**: Fire shot
